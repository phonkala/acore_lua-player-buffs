## Updates
```

```

## General  

This script is used to buff players based on class, talent spec and level range.  

The script was originally just a casual learning experience / introduction to
Lua language, but it actually seems quite handy on my private AzerothCore server!  

## Usage  

More info inside the file **[/player_buffs.lua](https://github.com/phonkala/acore_lua-player-buffs/blob/main/player_buffs.lua)**. Don't forget to apply the SQL queries.
